# Changelog

All notable changes to `aspire_data`.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added - `benchmarks` percentile toolkit (`percentile_of_mark` + age-band PBs)

One tested home for "what percentile is this mark?" and "best PB per age band",
so every app shares them instead of hand-rolling. `standard_bands` already gives
percentile -> mark (the chart bands); these add the inverse and the per-age-band
PB series, all against the same historical Power-of-10 norms
(`aspire_data_event_percentiles`, integer-centred bands '12.5 - 13.5' etc.).

- **`percentile_of_mark(event, mark, *, age=None, query=None, norms=None)`** ->
  percentile `0..100` (float) or `None` (fail-soft) when the event has no
  international norm / the norms are unavailable. Interpolates linearly across
  every `p` column present (p0..p100, not just the five chart bands) of the age
  band whose centre is nearest `age`; marks beyond the best/worst column clamp
  to 100/0. Direction is implicit in the norms (the p100 column is always the
  best mark, faster OR farther) so it needs no direction flag and works for both
  run and field events; implement / hurdle-height events pick the age-correct
  variant. `age` is effectively required when an event has more than one band.
- **`age_band_centre(age)`** -> the integer-year band centre for a decimal age
  (lower edge inclusive at N-0.5: 12.5..13.499 -> 13, 13.5 -> 14), matching the
  table's stored bins so it feeds straight into `percentile_of_mark(age=...)`.
- **`age_band_label(age)`** -> the band's range string ('12.5 - 13.5'), matching
  the stored bin format for display in tables / hovers.
- **`best_pb_by_ageband(results, dob, *, event=..., with_percentile=False, ...)`**
  -> best mark per Power-of-10 age band for one athlete/event (fastest for track,
  farthest for field), one ascending row per band `{age_band, age_band_label,
  age, mark, date, n}`. With `with_percentile=True` each row also carries its band percentile - a
  percentile-per-age-band series, the input shape for future trajectory modelling.

First consumers: the endurance-dashboard Overview KPI tile (primary-event PB +
percentile) and competition-result percentile banding. 18 hermetic tests in
`tests/test_benchmarks.py` (pass `norms=` a DataFrame, no network).

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added - `aspire_data.vald` (VALD-from-Oracle reads)

One tested home for the VALD read logic that development_dashboard,
endurance-dashboard, DASH_VALD and vald-vercel each re-implement. Promoted from
`endurance-dashboard/data/vald_oracle.py`, generalised, and stripped of app
concerns (no app cache, no live-API overlay, no pandas, pure-Python aggregation
to keep the core dependency-free). Reads Oracle `vald_*` over the Sports API GET
table route; identity resolves deterministically via `athlete_identifiers`.

- **`vald_summary(player_id=... | mrn=...)`** - SAMS-resolved snapshot (latest CMJ
  jump height + peak power, latest 10/5 RJT Tf/Tc, short trailing series). Fail
  soft: `{matched: False}` with no vald_id, `{has_data: False}` when mapped but
  no tests.
- **`metric_history(vald_id, test_type, metric_name, limb='Trial')`** - per-session
  best on ForceDecks `vald_result`.
- **`cmj_history(vald_id, metric='Jump Height (Imp-Mom)')`** - CMJ convenience wrapper.
- **`rjt_history(vald_id, field='tf_tc')`** - SmartSpeed 10/5 RJT from
  `vald_smartspeed_result`. `RJT_FIELDS` maps tf_tc/contact/flight/height/rsi to the
  bare SmartSpeed field + session-best aggregation (contact=min, rest=max). Tf/Tc is
  `flightTimeOverContractionTime`, NOT `rsi`.
- **`acute_chronic(vald_id, metric=..., test_type='CMJ')`** - daily mean + 7d/28d
  rolling means + ACWR (HANA's FORCEDECK_ACUTE_CHRONIC shape, computed since Oracle
  has no pre-calc).
- **`asymmetry_history(vald_id, test_type, metric_name)`** - single-leg L/R
  asymmetry from `trial_limb`: per-session `(R-L)/mean*100`.
- **`squad_metric(vald_ids, test_type, metric_name)`** - one metric across many
  athletes in ONE query (squad heatmaps / adaptive-range population). vald_id match
  is case-insensitive (Oracle stores them upper-cased).

NOTE: not yet wired into the consumer apps (next step is to repoint
endurance-dashboard / development_dashboard at this module and delete their local
copies). 10 hermetic tests in `tests/test_vald.py`.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added - anthropometry + skeletal-age recall clients

Two new recall modules, same shape as `whoop` / `firstbeat` (resolve by SAMS
`player_id`, fail soft to an unmatched dict), so any squad app gets ISAK
anthropometry and bone-age/maturity without re-reading Oracle or re-deriving the
clinical math.

- **`aspire_data.anthro.anthro_summary(player_id=...)`** — reads `anthro_records`
  (one row per ISAK session, keyed by SAMS `player_id`; `mrn` fallback) and
  returns the latest session snapshot + a stature/body-mass growth series +
  the maturation (PHV) block. The derived block (BMI, sum-of-skinfolds, Durnin-
  Womersley body density / %BF, FFM/FM, Heath-Carter somatotype) is computed in
  the client. The ISAK math (`compute_calculated`, `heath_carter`,
  `somatotype_string`, `get_result`) is **promoted verbatim from DASH_Anthro
  `lib/`** so the formulas now live in one place; DASH_Anthro can delegate later.
- **`aspire_data.skeletal.skeletal_summary(player_id=...)`** — reads
  `aspire_data_skeletal_age` (one row per x-ray, keyed by `sams_id`; `mrn`
  fallback) and returns the latest assessment + full history (GP/FELS/TW bone
  ages, predicted adult height, % APH reached, maturity status, PHV band). Uses
  the stored maturity/PHV values, recomputing only as a fallback via
  `maturity_offset` (FELS - ChA), `maturity_status_from_offset` (+/-1 yr band)
  and `phv_status_from_pct_aph` (Pre/Approaching/Circa/Post), all promoted from
  DASH_Anthro `data/skeletal.py`.

First consumer: the endurance dashboard Anthropometric tab.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added - historical percentile norms (the band source for the benchmarking chart)

`aspire_data.benchmarks` now reads the **historical Oracle norms**
(`aspire_data_event_percentiles`, EVENT x AGE_BIN, mark at every 5% from
p0=worst..p100=best, from the Power-of-10 PERCENTILE_RANK norms) and reshapes
them into the percentile bands `aspire_dash.plots.percentile_age_chart` needs —
so the corridor is real normative data, never computed from a small squad.
Promoted from `development_dashboard/lib/percentiles.py` so every app shares it.

- `standard_bands(event, *, age=None, pct=(10,25,50,75,90), elite=100, query=None)`
  → `age` + `p{n}` columns (one row per age-bin centre), with implement / hurdle-
  height variants chosen per age bin for throws and 110mH. Includes `p100` for the
  chart's elite ceiling line.
- `percentile_norms(query=None)` — the table as a DataFrame (process-cached on the
  default Sports API path); `query(table, where, limit)` to reuse your app client.
- `map_norm_event(event, age=None)` — canonical Event -> norm EVENT name.
- `benchmark_inputs(...)` now also returns `bands` (from `standard_bands`) and
  `pct`, so one call gives marks + bands + standard line + direction + format.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added - benchmarks module (data layer for the aspire_dash benchmarking chart)

`aspire_data.benchmarks` shapes raw results into the inputs for
`aspire_dash.plots.percentile_age_chart`, so any sport's app wires data into the
chart without hand-rolling age, personal-best, direction, or standard logic
(the "aspire_dash component backed by an aspire_data helper" pattern):
- `benchmark_inputs(results, dob, sex, event)` -> one call returns
  `{marks, reference_lines, lower_is_better, value_format}` ready for the chart.
- `marks_from_results(results, dob, ...)` -> `[{age, mark, pb}]` (decimal age at
  result, running-best PB flags, direction inferred from the event).
- `standard_line(event, sex, pin=...)` -> a qualifying-standard reference line
  resolved from a pinned standards table (e.g. `world_athletics_u20_standards`).
- `event_direction(event)` -> (lower_is_better, value_format) for athletics.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added — Connect user directory on `ConnectAdminClient`

For org-wide "requested by / assign to" pickers (name + email) so apps stop
hand-rolling a user table:

- `get_current_user()` — the API key owner's record (username, first/last name,
  email, guid, user_role). NB: not the app visitor — inside a deployed Connect
  app the visitor is the `RSTUDIO_USER_NAME` env var.
- `list_users(prefix=None, page_size=500)` — every Connect user, auto-paginated
  (`GET /v1/users`). Each row: `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`,
  `user_role`, `guid`, `locked`, `confirmed`, ….
- `find_user(username_or_email)` — resolve one user by exact username/email
  (case-insensitive); maps a Connect app's `RSTUDIO_USER_NAME` → {name, email}.

First consumer: Operations Tracker (requestor picker → also auto-fills the
completion-email recipient). Requires a key allowed to enumerate users
(administrator sees all).

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed — `SamsClient` training-plan endpoints (were 404)

`list_training_plans` / `get_plan_roster` / `list_sport_roster` used the
`/api/ExternalApps/training-plans` paths, which SAMS returns **404** for, and
keyed plan ids on snake_case `training_plan_id` while the API returns
`trainingPlanId`. Repointed to the live `TrainingPlans/Search` +
`TrainingPlanPlayer/Search` endpoints; `list_sport_roster` now returns the picker
shape (`player_id`, `full_name`, `mrn`, `sport`, `photo_url`) and accepts
`committee_id`. Verified live: `list_sport_roster(1, days_back=14)` → 234 athletes.

### Added — picker/save shapes on `SamsClient`

- `search_athletes(q, *, limit, active_only)` — name/MRN search in the picker shape.
- `athlete_card(player_id)` — full athlete card (player_id, full_name, mrn,
  date_of_birth, age, sex, sport, photo_url) enriched with current enrollment
  (sport/discipline/target_event/coach), via the richer `/details` endpoint.

These let athlete apps drop their hand-copied `data/sams.py` roster layer.

### Added — Sports-API write helpers (promoted from DASH_Vyntus)

- `aspire_data.sports_api.sql_literal(v)` — quote a Python value as a MySQL literal
  for hand-built WHERE/DELETE clauses (None/bool/number/date/str, quotes escaped).
  Every Sports-API write app re-implemented this.
- `aspire_data.ingest.replace_children(api, table, key_col, key_val, rows)` —
  NON-destructive child-row replace (insert new generation, then delete the old by
  `max(id)` watermark) so a failed insert never wipes children. The idempotent
  save-children pattern (CPET breaths/stages, anthro, VALD).

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added — `aspire_data.pinboard`: Posit Connect pins (org CSV sharing)

Publish/read versioned datasets as Connect pins — the org-internal sharing
layer (colleagues read via Python/R/browser with their existing Connect
logins). Whole-file + last-write-wins, so it is a distribution layer over a
real store (Oracle), never an app's primary database.

- `publish_dataframe(df, name, title=..., type="csv")` — write/refresh a pin;
  each call is a new version. Bare names are auto-prefixed with the API key
  owner's Connect username (Connect rejects cross-owner writes — the exact
  username, e.g. `Kenneth.Mcmillan@ASPIRE.QA`, is resolved via
  `/__api__/v1/user` and cached).
- `read_pin(name, version=None)` — latest (or pinned-version) read-back.
- `pin_board()` / `full_pin_name()` for direct `pins` access.
- Optional dep: `pip install aspire_data[pins]`. Named `pinboard` (not
  `pins`) to avoid colliding with both the upstream `pins` package and the
  existing `aspire_data.pins` SHA-pin-drift module.
- First consumer: DASH_Anthro republishes an `anthro_records` pin after every
  Oracle write.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added — `aspire-data bump-pins`: lib SHA-pin drift report + rewrite

Apps pin `aspire_dash`/`aspire_data` to exact commit SHAs (deploy-what-you-
tested), so a library release does nothing until each pin is bumped — a
redeploy silently rebuilds with the old SHA (bit us 2026-06-10: SamsClient
retry shipped in 0.10.0 but apps rebuilt with 0.8.3). New `aspire_data.pins`
module + CLI subcommand:

- `aspire-data bump-pins` — resolve current main SHAs via `git ls-remote`,
  scan `<base>/*/requirements*.txt`, report ok / drift / branch per pin.
- `aspire-data bump-pins --apply` — rewrite drifted exact-SHA pins to current
  main. Branch refs (`@main`) and current pins are never touched. Then test,
  commit, redeploy each app.
- `--base DIR` overrides the default `~/Documents/posit-deploys` root.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added — SamsClient 5xx/transport auto-retry

`SamsClient` now retries GETs on 5xx responses and httpx transport errors
with exponential backoff (`retries=3`, `retry_backoff=0.5` → 0.5s/1s/2s),
restoring the urllib3.Retry semantics the per-app requests Sessions provided
before the wiring sweep delegated transport here (sams-attendance-dashboard
was the app that lost it). 4xx never retries; all SAMS traffic is GET so the
retry is idempotent-safe. Both knobs are constructor kwargs.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added — `aspire_data.ingest`: the generic messy-data ingest lane

Convergence of the two pipelines that independently grew the same machinery
(DASH_Anthro `ingest/` and the Smartabase `historical_data/pipeline.py`).
Domain parsers stay app-side; everything reusable now lives in one module:

- `resolve_names_ladder(...)` — the proven 4-step identity ladder: exact join
  (e.g. `athlete_identifiers.smartabase_name`) > profile-MRN → `sams_mrn` >
  durable human decisions > `identity.resolve_to_sams` (DOB ladder) with
  dob/sport hints. Plus `fetch_identifiers(api)` pager.
- `DecisionLedger` — durable yes/no/drop human decisions CSV; re-runs and new
  tables never re-ask (merges the anthro `decisions.json` and Smartabase
  `manual_matches.csv` patterns).
- `validate_ranges(df, rules)` — per-column physical-range nulling + report;
  `flag_future_dates(df, col)` — the D/M/Y-swap dry-run guard from anthro.
- `sanitize_col` / `infer_sql_type` / `build_ddl` — MySQL-safe columns with the
  65KB-row-cap sizing rules and the literal-`ID`-column reserved-name guard;
  standard identity/meta head (`row_uid` unique, `sams_*`, `match_*`).
- `deterministic_id(*parts)` — uuid5 natural-key ids (idempotent upserts);
  `chunked_upsert(api, table, records, key_columns=...)` — width-aware batches.
- 8 tests in `tests/test_ingest_lane.py` (offline; fake api/roster).

First consumer: `historical_data/pipeline.py` (Smartabase loads). Next:
DASH_Anthro `ingest/` should delegate here the way its matcher already does.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed — identity: same-year DOBs no longer count as strong evidence

- `resolve_to_sams` auto-linked "Saleh Al-Sadi" (born 2004-06-15) to
  "Saeed Salem Salem" (born 2004-11-29): the DOB gap was computed by **year
  subtraction**, so any same-year pair scored gap 0, and the `:8080` engine's
  phonetic over-score (Saleh≈Salem, 90) tipped it over the `ns>=88 & gap==0`
  auto rule. Found during the Smartabase historical-data migration.
- New `dob_relation(a, b)` implements Kenny's three-tier DOB ladder:
  **exact date** > **day/month-swapped** (dd-mm vs mm-dd transposition — same
  date through the other entry convention, now treated as strong evidence and
  surfaced as `dob_swapped` in the candidate dict) > **fractional-year gap**
  (real date arithmetic, so 2004-06-15 vs 2004-11-29 is gap 0.46, not 0).
- Verdict changes: the `ns>=88` auto rule now requires exact/swapped DOB
  (same-year alone falls to `review`); `ns>=92` auto now uses the real ≤1y
  gap; swapped-DOB confidence bonus +14 (exact stays +18).
- Regression tests: the Saleh case must be `review`, a dd-mm/mm-dd transposed
  pair with a shared distinctive surname must auto-link.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed — `firstbeat_summary` was DOA (NameError)

- `aspire_data.firstbeat.firstbeat_summary` called `httpx.get(f"{_base()}…",
  verify=_verify())` but the module imported none of `httpx` / `_base` /
  `_verify` — so it raised `NameError` the instant an id resolved. No test
  covered it, so it shipped broken in 0.4.0. Now routes through `_common.get`
  (the same shared, cached client `whoop.py` uses) and drops a duplicate local
  `_num`. Any consumer that imported it (e.g. a wearable recall panel) was
  getting a hard crash — this is the fix.

### Added — nutrition-recall helpers promoted from aspire-nutrition

- `aspire_data.firstbeat.firstbeat_ee_by_slot(player_id|mrn, start, end)` →
  `{(date_iso, 'AM'|'PM'): kcal}`, mapping measured energy expenditure onto a
  SAMS training-plan grid. Includes the **AM-default `_ampm` fix**: a blank/
  unparseable session start time buckets to **AM** (morning training is the
  norm), not PM — the old PM default dumped a whole day's EE into the PM column.
- `aspire_data.identifiers.all_identifiers()` (whole table, 1 h cache) +
  `identifiers_by_mrn()` ({sams_mrn: row}) — bulk lookups for roster grids /
  MRN-keyed dashboards without a resolve_ids() per athlete.

8 new hermetic tests (`tests/test_wearables_v082.py`) — the regression that
would have caught the firstbeat bug, plus AM/PM parsing + cache behaviour.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-06-10

### Added — raw REST passthrough on SportsApi

- `SportsApi.get(path, **params)` / `SportsApi.post(path, json=...)` — for the
  non-tools Sports API REST surfaces (`/api/fencing/*`, `/api/service/match`,
  `/api/firstbeat/*`, ...). Auth/base-URL/TLS stay library-side; apps stop
  hand-rolling `requests` for these routes. Unblocks the
  DASH_Fencing_Reports_App migration (~30 call sites behind one `_get/_post`
  seam) and gcc-games' `sams_loader` match endpoint.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added — aspire-kb-api client (5th Connect FastAPI now covered)

- `aspire_data.aspire_kb` — `kb_search()` (POST /retrieve: hybrid/vector/bm25,
  opt-in rewrite / multi_query_n / hyde / rerank), `kb_sources()`, `kb_stats()`,
  `kb_document(doc_id)`. Pure HTTP — embedding + cross-encoder stay server-side,
  no PyTorch in consumer apps. Env: `ASPIRE_KB_API_GUID` (+ shared CONNECT_*).
- `aspire-data status` now probes aspire-kb-api `/health` alongside the other
  four Connect APIs.
- `.env.example` + test stub env gained `ASPIRE_KB_API_GUID`.

### Fixed

- `__init__` docstring: removed stale `NUTRITION_API_URL`/`NUTRITION_API_KEY`
  (no such client exists — leftovers from the nutrition extraction); env list
  now matches `.env.example` exactly, including the per-service Connect GUIDs.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added — write-safe + REST surface on SportsApi (unblocks app migrations)

- `SportsApi.tool_raw(name, **params)` — full envelope (ok / result.success /
  rows_affected), for callers that need more than the records list.
- `SportsApi.tool_write(name, **params)` — write tools with the inner-success
  guard: the Sports API returns HTTP 200 even when a write FAILS; this raises
  `SportsApiWriteError` on inner `success=False` (the silent-failure trap).
- `SportsApi.table(name, where=, order_by=, desc=, limit=, offset=)` — the
  generic `GET /api/v1/table/{name}` full-extraction surface with offset
  pagination (what apps were hand-rolling; the `tool("query_table")` path is
  the 20-row preview).
- `aspire_data.motherduck.duckdb_conn()` recreated — was advertised in
  `__init__` docstring + the `[duckdb]` extra but the module was lost in the
  history rewrite. Lazy duckdb import; scratch-only / no-PII policy in docstring.

### Changed — connection reuse + caching (perf)

- New private `aspire_data/_common.py`: single home for `_base`/`_verify`/`_num`
  (previously copy-pasted across 5 modules) + a shared, cached `httpx.Client`
  for the Sports API. One athlete-card render used to cost 4 TLS handshakes.
  (`supplements` keeps its own default-0.0 `_num` — its sums rely on it.)
- `connect.py` convenience wrappers (`hana_sql`, `jobs_get`, `notify_send`, …)
  now reuse a cached `ConnectClient` per GUID instead of opening + leaking a
  fresh TLS connection per call (worst in `jobs_wait` poll loops).
- `identifiers.resolve_ids` — 10-min TTL cache on the hottest path in the
  package (called per athlete card by `whoop_summary`/`firstbeat_summary`).
- `supplements` reads (`fetch_products/receipts/assignments`) — 60s TTL cache;
  `assign()` bypasses the cache for the over-issue guard (`fresh=True`) and
  invalidates after a successful write. Correctness over speed on the write path.
- `aspire_data._common.reset_caches()` — clears cached clients + registered
  TTL caches (tests / long-lived processes).

### Fixed

- `aspire-data status` was lying: render/jobs/notify-api probes were a dead
  stub that printed OK without any HTTP. Now really probe `/health` per GUID.
- Stale `/sports/fip/calendar` examples (route deleted 2026-04-27) updated to
  the live `/fip/calendar` shape in hetzner.py, connect.py, README, tests.
- `hana_sql_subprocess`: documented the hdbsql argv-password exposure and the
  `hdbuserstore -U` migration path (single-user laptop path, unchanged).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added — `identity` module: DOB-first name → SAMS resolution

`from aspire_data.identity import resolve_to_sams` — map a list of historical
athletes (`{name, dob?, sport?}`) to SAMS player_ids.

- **DOB-first**, not name-score-first. A long historical name ("Mohammed Aly
  Abdelmonem Monsef Noufal") tanks the fuzzy name-score so the top name match is
  often the WRONG person; an exact DOB + a distinctive (surname) token nails the
  right one (Mohamed Noufal). The pool = rapidfuzz blocking **AND** every exact-DOB
  roster athlete; verdict scores DOB + distinctive-token + sport.
- **The `:8080` Sports API match engine is the authoritative scorer** (8-layer
  alias/phonetic/Jaro-Winkler — handles Arabic transliteration variants); rapidfuzz
  is only cheap blocking + offline fallback. Auto-used when `SPORTS_API_URL` is set;
  `use_match_api=False` forces offline. `match_pairs()` exposed as the primitive.
- Verdicts: `auto` (linked) / `review` / `reject` / `no_match`. Common first names
  (Mohammed/Ahmed/Ali…) never auto-link on their own; Jan-1 DOBs treated as placeholders.
- `fetch_roster()` pulls the active roster via `SamsClient` (empty search → full
  roster). Adds `rapidfuzz>=3.0` dep. 9 tests in `tests/test_identity.py`.
- Extracted from the DASH_Anthro anthropometry migration (`ingest/matcher.py`).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added — supplement inventory client (shared with aspire-supplements)

`aspire_data.supplements` — read an athlete's supplement history and assign
stock against the same Oracle tables the `aspire-supplements` app uses, with
the over-issue guard built in (no re-implementing inventory maths):
- `athlete_history(player_id=…)` — past assignments, newest first, with name
- `products_on_hand()` — catalogue + remaining stock (received − assigned)
- `assign(sams_player_id=…, product_id=…, quantity=…, …)` — writes an
  assignment; raises `OverIssueError` when quantity exceeds on-hand
  (override with `allow_negative=True`). Requires `SPORTS_WRITE_API_KEY`.
- `fetch_products` / `fetch_receipts` / `fetch_assignments` / `on_hand`
Env-only config (`SPORTS_API_URL`, `SPORTS_WRITE_API_KEY`).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added — athlete identifier resolution + WHOOP / Firstbeat recall

Promoted from the `aspire-nutrition` consultation module. Deterministic
SAMS→device-id mapping (no name matching) + read-only wearable recalls.

**New modules:**
- `aspire_data.identifiers` — `resolve_ids(player_id=…, mrn=…)` returns the
  `athlete_identifiers` row (whoop_id / firstbeat_id / vald_id / gymaware_id /
  …); `device_id(row, field)` pulls one id, treating blank/0 as missing.
- `aspire_data.whoop` — `whoop_summary(player_id=…, mrn=…)`: today's recovery /
  HRV / RHR / strain / sleep + 7/30-day averages + daily series + sleep stages.
  `recovery_zone_color()` helper.
- `aspire_data.firstbeat` — `firstbeat_summary(player_id=…, mrn=…)`: last-week
  sessions / duration / energy (kcal) / TRIMP load / aerobic-TE intensity /
  ACWR + 14-day load series. `acwr_zone_color()` helper.

All env-only config (`SPORTS_API_URL`, `INSECURE_API_TLS`); no hardcoded
hosts/GUIDs. Resolve names (only if unavoidable) via the Sports API AI
resolver, never a local fuzzy match.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added — SAMS PlayerEnrollmentPeriods integration

Promoted from the `DASH_Anthro` Connect app. Canonical way to get
authoritative sport + discipline + competition event for an athlete.

**New on `SamsClient`:**

- `get_all_enrollment_periods() -> list[dict]` — fetches every row from
  `/api/ExternalApps/PlayerEnrollmentPeriods` (1000+ rows, ~415 KB),
  cached at the same TTL as the athlete-context cache (1h default).
- `get_current_enrollment(player_id: int) -> dict` — picks the most
  relevant **current** (endDate=None) enrollment for one player:
  primary first, else most-recent `startDate`. Returns `{}` if none.
- `get_athlete_context(player_id, *, enrich=False)` — new `enrich`
  flag. When `True`, merges current enrollment data onto the returned
  dict: `sport_id`, `sport`, `discipline_id`, `discipline`,
  `target_event` (first non-TBD token of `targetEventNames`),
  `target_event_raw`, `player_type`, `coach_name`. Default `False`
  preserves the existing API for current callers.

**New module-level helper:**

- `first_target_event(raw: str | None) -> str | None` — splits a
  comma-separated `targetEventNames` string, skips "TBD" tokens,
  returns the first usable event.

### Why

The `/api/ExternalApps/player/{id}` endpoint doesn't reliably surface
`sportId` for multi-sport athletes, and never surfaces the specific
event (Foil/Epee/100m/Hammer Throw/etc). Enrollment periods are the
authoritative source for both.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`tests/`** — 46 pytest cases covering smoke imports, ConnectClient
  + the 4 convenience wrappers, SportsApi (parameters envelope + records
  unwrap), SamsClient (search + MRN cache + auth), Oracle pool URL
  parser + env-required validation, Aiven env-required, Hetzner proxy
  + direct mode, Posit admin, the CLI (env / status / status --json).
  Stubs httpx via a recording mock — no live network calls.
  **Run time: ~2 s.**
- **`pyproject.toml`** — pytest config (testpaths, addopts).
- **`__all__` exports** on every public module — clearer surface for
  IDEs + cleaner `from aspire_data.X import *` semantics.
- **CI matrix** — `.github/workflows/audit.yml` now runs the audit
  AND the pytest suite on Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12.

### Changed
- Bumped `__version__` to 0.2.0 across `__init__.py` + `setup.py`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

Initial release. Sibling of `aspire_dash` covering the data layer.

### Added

- **`aspire_data.ssl_fix`** — `inject_truststore()` auto-fires on
  package import. Fixes the Aspire MITM TLS chain (GlobalProtect
  re-signs all HTTPS with a corp CA that's in the Windows trust
  store but not in `certifi`).
- **`aspire_data.connect`** — `ConnectClient(guid)` for any Connect
  content, plus convenience wrappers: `hana_sql`, `hana_view`,
  `render_pdf`, `render_doc`, `jobs_submit`, `jobs_get`, `jobs_wait`,
  `notify_send`.
- **`aspire_data.sports_api`** — `SportsApi.tool(name, **params)`
  hides the `{"parameters": {...}}` request envelope + the
  `result.data.records` response unwrap.
- **`aspire_data.sams`** — `SamsClient` with picker drill-down,
  `search`, `get_athlete_by_mrn`, `get_athlete_context`,
  `list_training_plans`, `get_plan_roster`, `list_sport_roster`.
  Parallel sport-roster fan-out via internal `ThreadPoolExecutor`
  (10 workers). 1h athlete-context cache, 30min sport-roster cache.
- **`aspire_data.oracle`** — async pools for Oracle VM:
  - `mysql_pool()` with the right defaults (`autocommit=False`,
    `utf8mb4`, `connect_timeout=10`)
  - `with_fresh_snapshot(conn)` context-manager that
    `await conn.rollback()` before a read — fixes the stale
    REPEATABLE-READ snapshot bug that has bitten every consumer
  - `postgres_pool()` standard `asyncpg` pool
- **`aspire_data.aiven`** — sync context-managers for Aiven Postgres
  (`psycopg`) and Aiven MySQL (`pymysql`) with SSL required.
- **`aspire_data.hetzner`** — `HetznerClient` with the proxy-vs-direct
  routing baked in. Defaults to the proxy (HTTPS 443) — set
  `direct=True` only on the Oracle VM or via SSH tunnel.
- **`aspire_data.hana`** — three paths to SAP HANA in one module:
  - `hana_sql_via_connect()` — via hana-api on Connect (RECOMMENDED)
  - `hana_sql_direct()`     — via `hdbcli` (install via Kakao mirror
    on Aspire laptop)
  - `hana_sql_subprocess()` — via `hdbsql.exe` subprocess (last-resort)
- **`aspire_data.posit`** — `ConnectAdminClient` for the Connect REST
  API: `get_content`, `list_content`, `patch_content`, `list_jobs`,
  `get_job_log`.
- **CLI**: `aspire-data status` pings every env-configured endpoint
  and prints OK / FAIL / skip verdicts. `aspire-data env` shows
  which env vars are set (without leaking values).
- **`.env.example`** at the repo root — copy + fill in.

### Public-safe design

- All hostnames + keys come from env vars
- README + tests use placeholders only
- No hardcoded internal Aspire infrastructure
